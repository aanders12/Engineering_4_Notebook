### Assignment Description
the assignment was to program a calculator that would recieve the sum, difference, product, quotiient, and modulo within a singular function given two variables.

### Reflection
This assignment introduced the code of str(), round(), and creating our own function. I completed within the block day period with little mess up, but did have to do reasearch into the language of python as expected. Overall, great assignment that contributed to a better developed set of coding skills.

## Quadratic_Solver

### Assignment Description
The assignment was to program a simple code that would solve a quadratic function when variables would be input.

### Reflection
This assignment saw the reapperance of creating a function, combined with the new usage of mathematic commands in python. It took me two class periods to complete, the main thing to halt progress was the research of the new forms of code and insuring I understood the formation.
