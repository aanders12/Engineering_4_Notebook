## Python Calculator

### Assignment Description
the assignment was to program a calculator that would recieve the sum, difference, product, quotiient, and modulo within a singular function given two variables.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does. For code only assignments like the Python calculator, include a screenshot of the output of the code.


### Reflection
This assignment introduced the code of str(), round(), and creating our own function. I completed within the block day period with little mess up, but did have to do reasearch into the language of python as expected. Overall, great assignment that contributed to a better developed set of coding skills.
