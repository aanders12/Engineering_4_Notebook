## Python_Calculator

### Assignment Description
the assignment was to program a calculator that would recieve the sum, difference, product, quotiient, and modulo within a singular function given two variables.

### Reflection
This assignment introduced the code of str(), round(), and creating our own function. I completed within the block day period with little mess up, but did have to do reasearch into the language of python as expected. Overall, great assignment that contributed to a better developed set of coding skills.

## Quadratic_Solver

### Assignment Description
The assignment was to program a simple code that would solve a quadratic function when variables would be input.

### Reflection
This assignment saw the reapperance of creating a function, combined with the new usage of mathematic commands in python. It took me two class periods to complete, the main thing to halt progress was the research of the new forms of code and insuring I understood the formation.

## Strings and Loops

### Assignment Description
the assignment was to create a program that splits a simple semtence, given by user input.

### Reflection
my main source of issue was sequencing errors, but after overcoming those troubles I had a better grasp of understanding exactly what functions were doing, it was a hardship that left me more advanced and better improved at python. The new aspects of code covered were strings, split functions, and a revist to for loops. My apreaciation for pythons simple and sleek code language is great.

## Man_Shaped_Pinata

### Assignment Description
the assignment was to create a program that would propose the infamous hangman game, it needed to incorporate input from two players, a pattern print, and word recognition

### Reflection
This project was definitley difficult but really incorporated the previous projects to meet a grand conclusion. It took a better understanding of syntax to furthur devolop the complexities of the code and how it orcastates. The layering of skills was well incorporated and the limited instruction required me to play off of others ideas to come to my own conclusion. I think I did well and was only frustrated a few times.

## CAD_Swing_Arm

### Assignment Description
I was to replicate a swing arm design based on it's drawings, and the to set the material to determine different masses.

### Reflection
This project was the first to reintroduce me to onshape this year. It was relatively challenging but I appreaciated the difficulty. The ability to create a design based on limited information and contextualization of given information is a skill better practiced. It is the continuation of my advancing skill set.

## Intro_To_CAD

### Assignment Description
Follow a step  by step to design a skateboard with all it's exeptional parts. assigned 2.1-2.5

### Evidence

### Reflection
This project was our second entry of CAD to start the year off, where I designed a deck, trucks, bearings ect. I found the tutuorial aspect to be a bit slow and hard to focus, and I often skimmed to get directly towards dimensions and other editing aspects. Though, following a tutorial with great effieciency allowed me to learn new options of design. I was using parts I otherwise wouldn't of used, or had since forgotten about since the summer, but now that knowledge has been rekindled.

## Intro_To_CAD_Duck

### Assignemt Description
Follow step by step instructions to design a lego brick duck. Assigned 3.1-3.4

### Evidence

### Reflection
This assignemnt deepened my understanding of the many features on onshape assembley and design. As well as being my first expirence with creating drawings and uploading visual instructions. I aquired more skills concerning configurations and it was further amplified by aplying more variables ontop of other variables. I now have the skills of explosions, snap mates, and drawings under my tool belt and hopefully can use them again in the future.

## RPi_Safe_Shutdown_Button

### Assignment Description
There was dire need to establish a suffiecent means of shutdown, considering the raspberry pi's are sensitive to sudden disconnect, I was tasked to create a button with
two task. 1) Get the script to work so that the RPI reboots when the button is tapped and shuts down when the button is held, and 2) Ensure the script runs automaticallyv in the background everytime the RPi boots up.

### Reflection
The hardest part of this assignment was putting the gif in for evidence. It was not particularly hard but all of my blunders where usuallay caused by skimming code and instructions, so I faced a few issue with instances such as; accidently copying the code twice in the nano window, forgetting/deleting the shutdown callback (this called my button to only ever restart), and not reading the different triggers for shutdown and restart (long press, short press). Though, having to figure my way through user error increased my likelihood of slowing down and insuring I am comprehending what I am doing by just a little more.
