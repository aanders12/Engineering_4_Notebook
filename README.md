## Python_Calculator

### Assignment Description
the assignment was to program a calculator that would recieve the sum, difference, product, quotiient, and modulo within a singular function given two variables.

### Reflection
This assignment introduced the code of str(), round(), and creating our own function. I completed within the block day period with little mess up, but did have to do reasearch into the language of python as expected. Overall, great assignment that contributed to a better developed set of coding skills.

## Quadratic_Solver

### Assignment Description
The assignment was to program a simple code that would solve a quadratic function when variables would be input.

### Reflection
This assignment saw the reapperance of creating a function, combined with the new usage of mathematic commands in python. It took me two class periods to complete, the main thing to halt progress was the research of the new forms of code and insuring I understood the formation.

## Strings and Loops

### Assignment Description
the assignment was to create a program that splits a simple semtence, given by user input.

### Reflection
my main source of issue was sequencing errors, but after overcoming those troubles I had a better grasp of understanding exactly what functions were doing, it was a hardship that left me more advanced and better improved at python. The new aspects of code covered were strings, split functions, and a revist to for loops. My apreaciation for pythons simple and sleek code language is great.

## Man_Shaped_Pinata

### Assignment Description
the assignment was to create a program that would propose the infamous hangman game, it needed to incorporate input from two players, a pattern print, and word recognition

### Reflection
This project was definitley difficult but really incorporated the previous projects to meet a grand conclusion. It took a better understanding of syntax to furthur devolop the complexities of the code and how it orcastates. The layering of skills was well incorporated and the limited instruction required me to play off of others ideas to come to my own conclusion. I think I did well and was only frustrated a few times.
