## Lego Duck in CAD
  the assignment consisted of parts 3.1-3.4 and introduced simpler and more concise means of design. 
  I became more familiar with drawings, variables/configurations, and features of the assembly tab 
  such as the snap fit mate, exploded view, and fitting a part immediatley to the origin.
